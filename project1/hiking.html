            S&oacute;lheimaj&ouml;kull glacier is an outlet from the mighty M&yacute;rdalsj&ouml;kull and is surrounded
            by some of Icelandâ€™s most grand volcanoes. During summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the
            glacier, only adding to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real
            contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
